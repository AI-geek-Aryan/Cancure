CanCure
CanCure is an advanced AI-powered healthcare tool designed to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of critical cancers. It leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze medical images such as MRI scans, mammograms, and CT scans with high accuracy.
The system automates the entire image analysis process by detecting anomalies, classifying tumor types, and generating diagnostic insights in real time. This not only minimizes the time required for diagnosis but also reduces the chances of human error, helping healthcare professionals deliver faster and more reliable care.
